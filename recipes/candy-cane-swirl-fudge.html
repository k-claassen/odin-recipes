    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It only takes 15 minutes to prep this festive holiday fudge recipe. Use gel food coloring instead of liquid food coloring for the most vibrant color.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 - 12 oz packages white baking chips (4 cups)</li>
        <li>1 - 14 oz can (11/4 cups) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp peppermint extract</li>
        <li>Red gel food coloring</li>
        <li>Crushed candy canes or peppermint candies (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Line an 8-inch square baking pan with foil, extending foil over edges. Butter foil.</li>
        <li>In a heavy medium saucepan combine 1 package white baking chips and 2/3 cup of the sweetened condensed milk. Heat and stir over medium-low just until melted and smooth. In a second pan, repeat with the remaining package white baking chips and 2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk. Stir peppermint extract and food coloring into one of the mixtures until bright red. Remove both mixtures from heat.</li>
        <li>Alternate adding spoonfuls of red and white mixtures to prepared pan. Spread mixtures evenly; using a butter knife, swirl mixtures together until marbled. If desired, sprinkle with crushed candies. Cover and chill about 2 hours or until firm. Use foil to lift out uncut fudge. Cut into pieces.</li>
    </ol>
