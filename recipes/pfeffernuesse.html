    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These itty-bitty cookies are a holiday tradition in Europe. If you like gingerbread or gingersnaps, you'll love pfeffernuesse!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup molasses</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground allspice</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan combine molasses and butter. Cook and stir over low heat until butter melts. Pour into a large bowl; cool to room temperature. In a medium bowl stir together flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, cardamom, allspice, and pepper; set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir egg into molasses mixture. Stir in flour mixture until combined, kneading in flour mixture, if necessary. Divide dough in half. Wrap and chill for 1 to 2 hours or until dough is easy to handle.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Divide half of the dough into 6 portions. On a lightly floured surface or wooden board, roll each portion of the dough into a 10-inch rope, about 1/2-inch thick. Cut ropes crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces. Place pieces 1/2 inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake about 10 minutes or until edges are firm and bottoms are light brown. Transfer to paper towels and let cool. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Fill a decorated recycled paper towel tube with cooled pfeffernuesse. Seal ends.</li>
